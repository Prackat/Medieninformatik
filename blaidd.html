                    Blaidd is an NPC in Elden Ring. Blaidd is a half man, half wolf,
                    found howling in the Mistwood Ruins. He's the trusted companion
                    and guardian of Ranni the Witch. Blaidd can be also be found as
                    an NPC Summon, if conditions are right.

                    Kal√© sent you, did he? Ever the bloody busybody. Hmm. Maybe to
                    him, you don't seem so strange. The name's Blaidd. I'm looking
                    for a man who goes by "Darriwil."

                <h4>BLAIDD LOCATION IN ELDEN RING</h4>
                <p>
                    Blaidd can be found initially at Mistwood Ruins, but must be
                    found as part of his quest.

                    Can become hostile if the player kills ANY of the large rune
                    bears before meeting him. (It's unclear why this makes him
                    hostile, but several reports have shown him becoming hostile
                    for no apparent reason, and the only link seems to be a rune
                    bear being slain at ANY location prior to hearing his
                    howling.)

                    Should Blaidd be hostile at the first encounter (maybe a
                    Bug) you can visit the Church of Vows.

                    After Atonement, Blaidd will reset. All Questlines involving
                    Blaidd can be completed successfully.

              <ul>
                <li>Inside Mistwood, the player can occasionally hear a wolf howl.
                At this point, they can ask Merchant Kale about the howling. The
                merchant will teach the player the Finger Snap gesture.</li> 
                <li>Blaidd can be seen resting on the tallest point in the Mistwood Ruins,
                and will jump down after the player uses the gesture while
                standing below him. Blaidd will tell the player he is searching
                for a man who goes by the name "Darriwil".</li>
