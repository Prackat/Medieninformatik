              Elden Ring is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by
              FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It was
              directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by
              fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. The game was released for
              PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series
              X/S on February 25. In Elden Ring, players control a customizable
              player character on a journey to repair the Elden Ring and become
              the new Elden Lord. The game is presented through a third-person
              perspective, with players freely roaming its interactive open
              world. Gameplay elements include combat using several types of
              weapons and magic spells, horseback riding, and crafting.
              FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay
              similar to their existing Dark Souls series, intending Elden Ring
              to act as an evolution of Dark Souls. Miyazaki admired Martin's
              work and hoped his contributions would produce a more accessible
              narrative than FromSoftware's previous games. Elden Ring received
              critical acclaim for its open-world, gameplay systems, and
              setting, with criticism going towards technical performance issues
              upon release. By July 2022, the game had sold more than 16.6
              million copies.
